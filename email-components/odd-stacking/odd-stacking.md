# Unconventional stacking behavior 
  - Rather than having the rows stack on top of each other vertically, this design aimed to take the middle item and have it stack on top of the first and last item (desktop & mobile screenshots are in the images folder)
  - odd-stacking.html has the example code of this stacking behavior
  - May contain some project specific CSS, would reccomend lifting only <tr>'s needed and not entire file
