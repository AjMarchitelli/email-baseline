# General info:
-   This is a good technique to use when the email design isnt very "boxy", therefore, hard to layout with tables
-   Allows for entirety of email to be a background image with text layered on top
-   Make sure to adjust those heights!

- May contain some project specific CSS, would reccomend lifting only <tr>'s needed (with any classes being used) and not entire file
